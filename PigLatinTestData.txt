The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. After that, he took off in his fast corvette and sped toward the super market; He purchased a number of strudels to eat. After that, he took a trip to the bank to make a withdrawal... of about $50,000! "Give me all the money!" said the fox to the clerk while wearing a ski mask. "No!" screamed the clerk, as he pushed the emergency call button. "Curses!" yelled the fox, as he quickly made his escape. However, the police arrived very quickly, and chased the fox down the highway. "What?!?!?! How could this be!!!" screamed the fox as he went over a spike strip. "Freeze! Put your paws where I can see 'em!" demanded the police officer. However, the fox went off the road next to a waterfall. "You'll never take me alive!" he cackled as he leaped over the edge and into the rapids below. A week later, a service was held by the fox's family. He only stole because he had a wife and kids to feed. However, the funeral had a surprise guest! The fox himself! How did he survive? Nobody knows, and he will never tell...
